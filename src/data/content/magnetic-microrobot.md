Why: Advancements in micro- and nanotechnology have enabled increasingly precise manipulation of matter at small scales, unlocking applications in medicine, material transport, and energy systems. One promising application is targeted drug delivery using micro-scale robots capable of controlled movement without invasive mechanical contact. The core challenge is achieving accurate, stable, and controllable motion at micro scales where traditional actuation mechanisms are impractical. This project aimed to design and prototype a magnetically actuated micro-robot capable of precise position control using a real-time feedback system.

---
What: The project resulted in the design, simulation, and fabrication of a magnetic micro-robot controlled through an external magnetic field and guided by a live camera-based feedback loop. The system allowed non-contact manipulation of the robot’s position and movement, with both automated control and manual override via joystick. While conceived as a foundational step toward drug delivery applications, the developed prototype demonstrated stable motion tracking and accurate response to input signals under laboratory conditions. The project was completed as my bachelor’s thesis and received a final grade of 19.3/20.

---
How: Multiple micro-scale locomotion mechanisms were evaluated before selecting magnetic actuation as the optimal approach due to its non-contact nature and controllability. A dynamic model of the system was developed to describe the relationship between magnetic field inputs and resulting motion. Movement equations were derived and simulated to assess stability, responsiveness, and controllability under varying conditions.

A closed-loop control system was implemented using a live camera to detect the robot’s position in real time. The positional data was processed and fed back into the magnetic control system, enabling continuous adjustment and trajectory correction. A joystick interface allowed switching between automated tracking and manual control modes. After simulation validation, the physical system was constructed and tested, confirming that the micro-robot could reliably follow input signals and maintain controlled positioning.
