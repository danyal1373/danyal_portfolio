Why: Collision repair shops operate in an environment where OEM repair manuals are dense, fragmented, paper-heavy and difficult to operationalize in real time. Technicians must manually interpret documentation alongside CCC-generated estimates, creating inefficiencies, inconsistency in execution, and potential compliance risk. As vehicles become more complex and OEM standards more stringent, the gap between static documentation and actionable repair workflow continues to widen. There was a clear opportunity to transform procedural knowledge into structured, context-specific guidance embedded directly into shop operations.

---
What: Repair Methods is an AI-powered platform that ingests OEM repair manuals and combines them with CCC estimate data to generate vehicle-specific repair procedures tailored to the exact damage profile. The system translates documentation into structured, digestible workflows, supported by concise data visualizations that enable technicians to select tools quickly and proceed with confidence. It integrates CCC’s parts database to accelerate ordering and delivery, and includes a Kanban-style tracking dashboard to improve shop-level visibility. The platform supports multiple stakeholders, with dedicated interfaces for repairers, adjusters, and customers, ensuring alignment, transparency, and compliance across the repair lifecycle. The product has been successfully published within the CCC product suite.

---
How: Following a Double Diamond methodology, we grounded the solution in existing in-house shop research and workflow observations. We began by analyzing how technicians interpret manuals and manage repair sequencing, identifying friction in translating estimates into compliant execution. The system architecture was designed to map estimate data to relevant OEM procedures through an AI-driven ingestion and contextualization pipeline. Outputs were structured to reduce cognitive load and fit naturally into existing shop workflows rather than disrupt them. By leveraging CCC’s established parts database and ecosystem position, the platform connects estimation, procedural guidance, procurement, and tracking into a cohesive operational layer.

## The Challenge

### Customer Pain Point

- The search for repair methods are very hard and time consuming.

- Paper repair methods are vulnurable in shop environment.

- New cars has different ways of repair.

- Communication overhead in a shop is burdonsome and cars are not that easily trackable.

### Organizational Constraint

- Leverage CCC Parts product.

- From estimation to repair, be with our customers.

- Respect the shop dynamics and design for usability.

- Design each facade so it help each user achieve their goal easier.

### Strategic Opportunity

Design a tool that improve shop's journey of car repair.

# Design Method

### Discover

We leveraged in-house research and workflow studies to understand how shops currently interpret OEM manuals, select tools, and track repairs. Friction points were identified in procedural interpretation, sequencing, and coordination between stakeholders. A disconnect between estimate generation and procedural execution emerged as the central systemic gap.

### Define

The challenge was reframed from providing access to documentation to delivering dynamic, estimate-driven repair intelligence. Clear system requirements were established around contextual procedure generation, workflow compatibility, multi-role visibility, and OEM compliance integrity.

### Develop

We designed an AI ingestion pipeline capable of parsing OEM documentation and mapping it directly to estimate line items. Repair procedures were structured into clear, step-based visual flows. A Kanban-style dashboard was developed to support operational tracking. Interfaces were designed for repairers, adjusters, and customers to ensure ecosystem alignment.

### Deliver
The platform was integrated into the CCC product line, improving repair consistency, reducing time spent interpreting manuals, and strengthening compliance alignment. It establishes a new operational layer within the repair workflow.
