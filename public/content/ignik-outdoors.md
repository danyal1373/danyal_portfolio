# Bringing warmth and comfort to the outdoors 


![Ignik Outdoors Heater](/images/projects/ignik-outdoors-heater.png)


```wwh
Why: Ignik Outdoors wanted to extend the duration and comfort of outdoor experiences for families while aligning with their sustainability mission. Customers were abandoning outdoor activities early due to cold and wet conditions, and the widespread use of disposable green butane tanks conflicted with Ignik’s environmental positioning.

---
What: We designed a portable, battery-powered heated table system that enabled families to remain outdoors longer in cold and damp environments, without reliance on disposable fuel canisters. The product complemented Ignik’s existing lineup and opened adjacent category expansion opportunities.

---
How: Through customer data analysis, qualitative interviews, structured requirement definition, and iterative prototyping, we identified thermal comfort at shared gathering points (e.g., tables) as a leverage point. We engineered a transportable heated table powered by rechargeable energy sources already familiar to customers, ensuring ecosystem compatibility and sustainability alignment.

## The Challenge

### Customer Pain Point

- Families (primary buyers) struggle with children’s discomfort in cold/rainy camping environments.

- Outdoor experiences end early due to thermal discomfort.

- Cold surfaces (tables, benches) amplify perceived environmental harshness.

### Environmental Constraint

- Disposable green propane/butane tanks contribute to environmental degradation.

- Ignik’s brand positioning emphasizes sustainable alternatives.

### Product Portfolio Constraint

Product needed to:

- Fit within Ignik’s sustainability narrative

- Complement existing heating solutions

- Strengthen adjacent product prospects

- Avoid cannibalization

# What we do

---
## “We help people get outside sooner and spend more time together”
```


## Design Method

### Discover

- Analyzed customer purchasing data → Families identified as dominant buyer segment.

- Conducted qualitative interviews with outdoor users.

- Field research in camping environments.

- Identified that discomfort is amplified at shared gathering nodes (tables), not just ambient air.

Key Insight:
Thermal discomfort during stationary activities (eating, gathering, supervising children) is the primary trigger for early retreat indoors.

### Define


**“How might we provide the warmth and comfort of a fire, post activity, for multi-generational communities while spending time outdoors?”**

Product Requirements:

- PorTable and easy to set up. With its "plug and play" design, you can easily load it up in your vehicle and take it with you wherever you go. 

- AdapTable no matter it's a sunny day at beach or a cold wintery night in your backyard

- ComforTable with enough space to accommodate up to four people, it's the perfect place to enjoy a meal, play a game, or simply sit and chat with friends.

- Durable in wet environments

- Cohesive with Ignik’s design language
