Why: The 5th Iranian Machine Design Competition challenged university teams to design and construct a civic electric motorcycle capable of competing in a full race weekend, including acceleration, speed, endurance, and reliability tests. The project required translating theoretical mechanical and electrical engineering knowledge into a fully operational, high-performance vehicle under strict competition constraints and timelines. Beyond performance, the motorcycle needed to satisfy structural integrity, manufacturability, and cohesive industrial design standards across two formal evaluation phases: design and construction.

---
What: As part of a thirteen-member interdisciplinary team formed under the name Pakrun, we designed and prototyped a fully functional electric sports motorcycle from the ground up. The project encompassed complete system architecture, including powertrain design, suspension system, braking system, chassis fabrication, battery selection, body development, and electrical integration. Our team secured first place in the design phase of the competition. In the final performance tests, the motorcycle achieved first place in the 100-meter speed competition, reaching over 140 km/h.

---
How: We began with benchmarking peer electric motorcycles and analyzing competition requirements to establish performance targets for acceleration, top speed, and structural stability. I led the design of the suspension and braking systems, ensuring dynamic stability under high acceleration and race conditions. I also contributed to motor power selection, speed and acceleration calculations, and acted as the intermediary between engineering and industrial design to maintain alignment between performance constraints and aesthetic intent.

# Team Pakrun

During the manufacturing phase, I joined a small fabrication team responsible for constructing the fiberglass and composite body. We executed CNC preparation, mold development, forging, surface finishing, and painting. The chassis was welded and assembled in-house, suspension components were integrated, battery compartments engineered, and wiring for actuators, sensors, and motor systems completed. Less than a week before the final race, an accidental fire damaged the motorcycles, forcing a complete rebuild under extreme time pressure. The team worked continuously to reconstruct and test the vehicle before competition, ultimately delivering a race-ready system.

# Design Method

### Discover

We analyzed competition constraints, benchmarked peer electric motorcycles, and defined performance targets for speed, acceleration, endurance, and handling. System-level interdependencies between motor output, weight distribution, battery capacity, and suspension geometry were mapped early in the process.systemic gap.

### Define

The challenge was framed as designing a race-capable electric motorcycle that balanced power, structural integrity, and manufacturability within limited resources and time. Clear subsystem ownership was established, and performance calculations informed motor selection, braking capacity, and suspension geometry.

### Develop

Suspension and braking systems were engineered to support high-speed stability and safe deceleration under race conditions. Powertrain components were selected based on torque and acceleration modeling. The chassis was fabricated and assembled in-house, followed by battery integration, electrical wiring, and composite body construction using fiberglass and carbon fiber techniques. After the fire incident, rapid redesign and reconstruction efforts were executed to restore structural and functional integrity.

### Deliver
The motorcycle passed design evaluation and won first place in the competition’s design phase. In performance testing, it achieved first place in the 100-meter acceleration event, exceeding 140 km/h, demonstrating successful integration of mechanical, electrical, and structural systems under competitive constraints.
